    <h1>Lab 10 Problem 3: Flask Web Page</h1>
    <p>How I installed Flask and built this page.</p>
    <h2>Installation Process</h2>
    <p>I already had Python installed, so I installed Flask by running <code>pip install flask</code> in the terminal.</p>
    <h2>Building the Page</h2>
    <p>I created a Python script <code>main.py</code> and an HTML template file <code>/templates/index.html</code> to display content on the web page.</p>
    <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
    <p>The main difficulty I encountered was understanding how Flask renders templates and sets up routes. I solved this by consulting Flask documentation and reading through tutorials on their official website.</p>
    <p>Flask requires a specific folder structure, such as placing HTML templates in the /templates directory. Initially, I tried rendering a file from the root directory, which resulted in an error. I read Flask's documentation, which clarified the need to place all templates in the /templates folder. I reorganized my files accordingly.</p>
    <p>This is what my <code>main.py</code> file looks like:</p>
    <pre><code>
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
    </code></pre>
</body>
</html>
